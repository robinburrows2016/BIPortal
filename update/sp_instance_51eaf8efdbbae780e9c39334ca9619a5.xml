		"value": "<h2>About the&nbsp;Take Pride+</h2>\n<p class=\"panel-body\">Take Pride+ is set up to allow you to do two things quickly &amp; easily &ndash; share your improvement ideas; and Speak Up For Quality by reporting quality issues, near misses or errors. Let&rsquo;s look at each in more detail:</p>\n<h4 class=\"panel-body\">Share Improvement Ideas</h4>\n<p class=\"panel-body\">We are asking everyone in Naval Ships to consider how to improve our business, thinking in terms of Safety, Quality, Delivery, Cost, People, and our Reputation. If you have something in mind, we&rsquo;d like you to raise it in this system. When you do so, assuming it&rsquo;s both beneficial and feasible, our dedicated team will work with you to try to turn it into a reality. Ideally that will mean that you stay involved throughout, and we jointly find and deliver a solution (and the associated benefits to the business)</p>\n<h4 class=\"panel-body\">Speak Up For Quality</h4>\n<p class=\"panel-body\">It&rsquo;s hopefully obvious to everyone how important Quality is within Naval Ships, in 2019 and beyond, especially in light of the challenges experienced in 2018. Alongside the wider Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) and other initiatives, we are launching this quick, simple and easy way for anyone in the business to stick up their hand, and report a Quality concern before it turns into a major issue. That may be an error or a near miss that you&rsquo;ve encountered personally, something you&rsquo;ve seen someone else do, or just a potential error that you&rsquo;ve come across in the course of your work. When this happens &ndash; tell us about it! Fill out the simple form on the homepage, and one of our team will pick it up and review it. We will take action on all Quality observations, investigating or escalating, trying to find an appropriate resolution and response. Like Improvement Ideas, we believe that the best solutions can be found when we work together, so we&rsquo;d like you to stay involved</p>\n<h4 class=\"panel-body\">Our Approach</h4>\n<p class=\"panel-body\">Just Culture &ndash; When we investigate Quality Observations, we are not looking for someone to blame. We work on the belief that in general, people don&rsquo;t fail &ndash; instead the processes around them fail, and that&rsquo;s what leads to errors. We want to encourage people to raise their hand, and Speak Up For Quality by applying a Just Culture approach &ndash; building and sustaining trust by focusing on the root cause of the error, issue or concern, and working hard to find a way to prevent it from happening again. We promote the distinction between deliberate acts of recklessness and misconduct, where action against individuals might be appropriate from genuine mistakes or errors of judgement. <br />Improvement Culture &ndash; We believe that the best way for the business to create and maintain a culture of improvement is to involve as many people as possible. That&rsquo;s why we will always look to include and upskill the people who are doing the job in finding ways to make that job safer / easier / cheaper / faster. We would love to be spending the majority of our time supporting, coaching &amp; helping people to make improvements happen for themselves</p>\n<h4 class=\"panel-body\">Our Commitment To You</h4>\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<ol>\n<li>We will review every single submission &ndash; we know that in the past your ideas seem to have gone into a &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;, and we will not allow that to happen again</li>\n<li>Every submission to this tool will receive regular feedback &ndash; when&nbsp; a decision is made about next steps, you will be the first to know</li>\n<li>If you ask us to keep your details confidential, we will respect that &ndash; on the submission forms you can ask for it to be confidential. If this is the case, we will not share your name or details with anyone outside of our Team</li>\n<li>You can be truly anonymous if you wish &ndash; you can write your observation down on a Take Pride+ Card, leave your name off, and drop it in one of our post boxes (although be aware that this may hamper our ability to investigate fully). If you are not based on the Clyde, you can do the same and send to us in internal mail (our contact details will always be up to date on the Team tab)</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
